    <string name="intro_bern">Bern or Berne is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville fédérale, and Italian città federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second\-most populous of Switzerland\'s cantons.</string>
    <string name="intro_culture">Bern is a city rich in culture and exciting history. For example the \"Kindlifresser Brunnen\" which translated means the child\-eating fountain in the center of Bern\'s old town.</string>
    <string name="kindlifresser_one">It was created in 1545/46 by Hans Gieng in place of a wooden fountain from the 15th century. The new fountain\'s original name was Platzbrunnen (Plaza Fountain); the current name was used first in 1666. Kindli is a Swiss German diminutive for the German word Kind, meaning child. A literal translation of the name Kindlifresserbrunnen therefore would be \"Fountain of the Eater of Little Children\".</string>
    <string name="kindlifresser_two">The fountain sculpture is a sitting ogre devouring a naked child. Placed at his side is a bag containing more children. Because the ogre is wearing a pointed hat resembling a Jewish hat, it has been speculated about the possibility of the ogre being the depiction of a Jew as an expression of blood libel against Jews. Another theory is that the statue is the likeness of Krampus, the beast\-like creature from the folklore of Alpine countries thought to punish children during the Christmas season who had misbehaved. According to other theories it is a depiction of the Greek god Cronus eating his children or the Roman Saturn eating the months, though Cronus should have six and Saturn twelve rather than the sculpture\'s eight.</string>
    <string name="baeren_intro">The Bern BearPark is a unique recreation area at the lower end of the old town of Bern. It is open around the clock and free for all visitors. Brown bears have been living in this generously-sized enclosure on the banks of the river Aare since 2009.</string>
    <string name="baeren_one">The Bern Bears are at home in the Bear Park in the middle of the city. The \“Mutzen\” have been living exclusively in the park on the Aarehang since 2009, with a view of the UNESCO\-designated Old Town of Bern.</string>
    <string name="baeren_two">A small forest, bushes, caves and a spacious bath parallel to the Aare offer the three Bernese brown bears the necessary comfort. A landscape was created here in which they can climb, fish and play, but also retreat. The 5,000 square meter site stretches from the former bear pit down to the banks of the Aare.</string>
    <string name="baeren_three">In December 2009, bear mama \“Björk\” gave birth to two cubs in a winter cave. Daughter \“Ursina\” still lives with her parents in the Bear Park, while \“Berna\” has found her new home in Bulgaria.</string>

    <string name="intro_kapitel">This is one of the few good techno clubs in the city of Berne. The line\-up is mostly great with amazing international dj\'s.</string>
    <string name="intro_dutheatre">This venue is good for rather young people that like lots of different kind of music from hiphop to salsa. It is located in the center of the old town.</string>
    <string name="intro_leciel">This venue is good for rather young people that like lots of different kind of music from hiphop to salsa. It is located next to the famous Reitschule</string>
